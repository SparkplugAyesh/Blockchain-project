# 🗳️ Blockchain-Based Voting System

A decentralized voting system built using **blockchain technology** to ensure **secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections**. This project showcases how digital trust can be established using cryptographic principles, making the voting process auditable and fraud-resistant.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔐 **Immutable Records**: Votes are recorded on a blockchain ledger.
* 👤 **Voter Authentication**: Ensures only eligible voters can cast a vote.
* 🔄 **One Person, One Vote**: Prevents double voting.
* 📈 **Real-Time Results**: Live updates without compromising vote privacy.
* 📊 **Audit Trail**: Full traceability and transparency.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python** (Flask for backend)
* **Blockchain Logic** (custom Python implementation)
* **HTML/CSS/JS** (for frontend interface)
* **JSON** (data serialization)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Voters are authenticated using a unique ID.
2. Vote is cast and added as a block to the blockchain.
3. Each block contains a cryptographic hash and timestamp.
4. All nodes share the same ledger, ensuring consensus.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

* `app.py` – Core backend logic
* `blockchain.py` – Blockchain implementation
* `templates/` – Frontend pages
* `static/` – CSS/JS assets

---

## ✅ Future Enhancements

* Multi-node blockchain deployment
* Biometric-based voter authentication
* Blockchain explorer dashboard
